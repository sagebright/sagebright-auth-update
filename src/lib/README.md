# Sagebright Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Sagebright app.

## Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

We've implemented code splitting using React's `lazy()` and `Suspense` to reduce the initial bundle size and improve loading times:

- All major page components are lazily loaded
- A standardized loading fallback is shown during component loading
- The app shell loads quickly while page content is fetched asynchronously

## React Performance Patterns

We use several React optimization patterns:

- `React.memo()` for pure components to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- `useMemo()` for expensive calculations or prop generation
- `useCallback()` for stable function references
- Optimized state management with proper dependency arrays

## Performance Monitoring

The `performance.ts` utility provides:

- Component render time measurement
- Operation timing
- Hooks for easier performance tracking
- Placeholder for web-vitals integration

## Bundle Size Optimization

To analyze bundle size:

1. Install source-map-explorer: `npm install --save-dev source-map-explorer`
2. Add to package.json: `"analyze": "source-map-explorer 'dist/assets/*.js'"`
3. Run: `npm run build && npm run analyze`

## Future Optimizations

Areas for future improvement:

- Image optimization with next-gen formats and responsive loading
- Server-side rendering for critical paths
- HTTP/2 and CDN integration
- Service Worker for offline capability
- Advanced caching strategies
