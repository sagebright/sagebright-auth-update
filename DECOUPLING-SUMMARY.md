# Sagebright Auth Decoupling Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed Supabase Direct Dependencies**
   - Deleted `supabaseClient.ts`
   - Replaced direct Supabase client imports with backend auth helper

2. **Created New Backend Auth Interface**
   - Added `backendAuth.ts` with typed interface for auth data
   - Implemented `fetchAuth()` and `checkAuth()` functions
   - Created temporary compatibility layer for transition

3. **Updated Context Hydration**
   - Modified context fetchers to use backend auth endpoint
   - Updated `fetchUserContext` and `fetchOrgContext` to use backend data
   - Ensured context building works with new data sources

4. **Updated Auth Provider**
   - Refactored `useAuthProvider` to use new auth interface
   - Removed Supabase-specific session initialization
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing components

5. **Improved Route Guards**
   - Updated route protection to use new auth backend
   - Ensured correct redirection for unauthenticated users
   - Maintained existing protection behavior

6. **Added Developer Tools**
   - Added `AuthDebug` component for development testing
   - Created developer debugging endpoints
   - Included detailed API documentation

## Backend API Contract

Created a clear API contract for the backend endpoint:
- `GET /api/auth/session`: Returns complete authentication payload
- Structured response with session, user, and org data
- Detailed documentation with expected payloads and errors

## Testing

Created a comprehensive test plan covering:
- Authentication flows
- Route protection
- Session persistence
- Error handling
- Context hydration
- Edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Implement the backend `/api/auth/session` endpoint
2. Remove deprecated Supabase environment variables
3. Complete removal of all `supabase` imports
4. Verify build output has no remaining Supabase references

This decoupling allows for a more controlled authentication process managed through our own backend, eliminating direct Supabase dependencies in the frontend code.
